## Overview
Led the design and development of a solid rocket motor using potassium nitrate composite propellant. Successfully launched rocket to altitudes exceeding 400 meters. This project was part of BUZ Aerospace's effort to establish practical rocketry capabilities at the school level.

## Key Contributions
- **Fuel development** and documentation
- Secured $580K in funding to build the school's first comprehensive makerspace facility
- Developed fuel formulation protocols and casting procedures
- Safety systems design and implementation

## Results
The rocket's successful flight demonstrated the viability of student-led aerospace projects and was featured in official school promotional materials. Documented entire development process through photography and videography to create educational resources for future student engineers.
