## Overview
Developed Korea's second end-burning hybrid rocket engine with $62K funding from school to establish dedicated Rocket Combustion Laboratory. Designed and constructed a novel ignition system that enables controlled end-burning combustion. This research explores innovative propulsion techniques to improve rocket efficiency and thrust control characteristics.

## Key Contributions
- **Igniter development** and ignition system design
- Novel ignition system enabling controlled end-burning combustion
- Extensive testing of ignition sequences and thermal protection systems
- Combustion chamber design optimization

## Results
Successfully demonstrated stable end-burning combustion with reproducible results across multiple test fires. The project involved extensive testing of ignition sequences, thermal protection systems, and combustion chamber design.
