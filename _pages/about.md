Hi, I'm Jeonghyun Lee, a student at Korean Minjok Leadership Academy with a strong interest in aerospace engineering and experimental physics. I work primarily on propulsion systems and experimental methods that explore how physical systems behave under real-world constraints.

I currently lead BUZ Aerospace, where I design and test hybrid rocket engines and help develop a student-led makerspace for hands-on engineering research. My work focuses on propulsion dynamics and acoustic sensing, with recent projects examining hybrid rocket combustion and fluid-induced acoustic signatures for aerospace safety applications.

Beyond research, I serve as captain of my school's lacrosse team and have participated in appropriate technology projects in Laos, experiences that shaped how I think about teamwork, responsibility, and engineering for impact rather than performance alone.

I am currently applying to universities to study aerospace engineering and physics. My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of reliable and efficient propulsion systems that expand the possibilities of space exploration through careful experimentation and design.
