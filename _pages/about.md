I'm a student at Korean Minjok Leadership Academy with a passion for rocket propulsion and experimental physics. I lead BUZ Aerospace, where we've secured over $640K in funding to build rockets and establish a school makerspace.

My research focuses on hybrid rocket engines and acoustic sensors for aerospace applications. I'm also captain of my school's lacrosse team and serve communities in Laos through appropriate technology projects.

Currently applying to universities to pursue aerospace engineering and physics. My goal is to contribute to the future of space exploration through innovative propulsion systems.
